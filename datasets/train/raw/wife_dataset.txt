 'I started believing in love only after I met you. I never thought in my life that I could fall head over heels in love with anyone until I met you.

Believe me – it kills me whenever I see you sad or cry. I always want to see you happy and would do anything and everything for it. Today, I also want to apologize to you for every time I made you feel bad and assure you that I will try to never repeat the same mistakes again.\n\nWhenever we fight, I feel guilty and want to embrace you and wipe all your tears, but sometimes my ego and pride take over. However, I want you to know that I do care for your feelings with all my heart. It is just that sometimes I do not show it to you. Please know that deep down, I will always love you and protect you till eternity.\n\nYours forever,',

 'As we celebrate another anniversary together, I would like to go down memory lane and remember the day when we first met. It is so silly to think now that we started our conversation with an argument and left thinking we will never see each other again.\n\nBut, destiny had other plans for us. We met again accidentally, and there was no going back. I am glad that day happened, and we had a great talk. Otherwise, I would have missed a wonderful and loving partner in life.\n\nWhat started as a chance meeting has continued for 15 amazing years. I cannot believe that we have been together for such a long time. Today, after spending so many years with you, when I look at you, I still see the same love and affection that I felt on that day.\n\nThank you for loving me unconditionally and being my life partner all these years. I wish for a lifetime of togetherness with you.\n\nYour loving husband,\n',
 'I never knew how happy and joyous life could be until I met you.

When I think about you and our relationship, I feel a certain warmth inside. I cannot help but feel fortunate even when we are apart.\n\nThe connection that we share, my love, is special, and I wonder what I would have done without you in my life. Love you forever and always.\n\nYour loving husband,\n',
 'I hope this letter finds you happy and healthy. I just want to let you know that even if it has been just a few hours that you are gone, I miss you already.\n\nSince we both hardly get any time from our busy schedules, I want to make an effort and find ways to rekindle our relationship. You are the biggest asset of my life. There has not been a single day when I was not thinking about you. You give so much meaning to my life and inspire me to become a better human being each day.\n\nThe very thought of spending several days without seeing you is making me anxious. It feels like being single again, and it is something that I do not want. I am so proud that you are my wife, and I feel so excited with the thought of sharing my entire life with you.\n\nYour hubby,\n',

The sky is bluer with you in my life, the grass is greener, and the birds are chirpier.\n\nThank you for being you and always having my back. I love you so much.\n\nYour darling husband,\n',
 'I sometimes cannot believe that we have been together for so many years, and it all still feels like yesterday. With you by my side, time seems to go by so fast.\nI will always cherish all the beautiful memories that we have made together. Life with you has been nothing short of a blessing!\n\nI know that our love has become the envy of all, and I would never change anything about the bond we share. Every day, I wake up with so many more reasons to fall in love with you all over again, and I never want to stop that feeling.\n\nLoving you has become a necessity for me, and I will always look for opportunities to sweep you off your feet. \nI adore you so much, my sweetheart,\n']
